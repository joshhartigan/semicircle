    <h1>Semicircle</h1>
    <p><i>Semicircle</i> is a project I started on May 23rd, 2014. The final
    goal of the project is to make 180 programs (or significant additions to
    programs) in any amount of time. I try to go on daily 'streaks' of
    contributions to the project, but I can't always do this.</p>
