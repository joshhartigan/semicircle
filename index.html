      <sup><i>bad look intentional</i></sup>

      <p><b>semicircle</b> is a project I started on May 23rd, 2014. The final
        goal of the project is to make 180 programs (or significant additions
        to programs) in any amount of time. I try to go on daily 'streaks' of
        contributions to the project, but I can't always do this.</p>

      <h3 style="text-decoration:underline">languages</h3>
      <p>i've used a lot of different languages for this project, and as an
        inevitable result I have opinions on them:</p>

      <h4>python</h4>
      <p>the most used language in this project, because it was the first
        language that I learned. It is very good for getting things done fast,
        but has some weird design features (i don't like <code>__this__</code>)
        and the significant whitespace is ugly and error-prone.</p>

      <h4>c++</h4>
      <p>it's easy to tell how powerful this language is, but it is also
        intimidating, because of how much syntax, structures, and features it
        has. The size of this language was the reason that I switched to
        learning C instead.</p>

      <h4>c</h4>
      <p>definitely challenging, but immensely rewarding afterwards. It is also
        helpful how C is the most popular programming language in the world, and
        how it makes you think about more how the computer is working - in
        comparison to languages like javascript and python.</p>

      <h4>html</h4>
      <p>not a programming language, i know. I really don't like how verbose,
        ugly (read - XML), and necessary it is. I would much rather write web
        markup with {braces} or significant whitespace, without having to use a
        preprocessor.</p>

      <h4>java</h4>
      <p>as a language i didn't find it bad necessarily, but boring. The whole
        enterprise-y spirit around the language doesn't make it any nicer, and
        its verbosity is often irritating and leads to confusion.</p>

      <h4>go</h4>
      <p>i can see why it is a good language for big companies, but for someone
        like me who just wants to run/compile a single-file program quickly, it
        isn't great. I haven't used it much.</p>

      <h4>javascript</h4>
      <p>i love it and hate it. It has a really good community (esp. npm,
        io.js), but it is a very weird language that takes some getting used to.
        Also I have a <strong>strong</strong> disliking for Brendan Eich.</p>

      <h4>clojure</h4>
      <p>cool! Lisp is different and fun.</p>

      <h4>haskell</h4>
      <p>i only have 1 brain and it is very pleased when it solves something in
        Haskell. I think the idea of pure functional programming is cool, and
        the typing system is really good.
        However, haskell has a very odd syntax and I'd prefer to stick with a
        lisp dialect for functional programming.</p>

      <h4>ruby</h4>
      <p>fun and friendly (if a language can be friendly). I see ruby as python
        with far better design. The big problem is finding help and resources
        that aren't related to rails.</p>

      <h4>css</h4>
      <p>not a programming language, just like HTML, i know!<br />
        It has a decent syntax. Everything else is really bad.</p>
